## Part a

### Describe what the code in `z3-test.py` is doing in a paragraph or two.

The code creates two boolean variables, a and b, and two integers, x and y. Then, it assigns a predicate to the variable f and adds f to a solver once it's initialized. Then, the program prints out the results of the model being checked and if the model is satisfied, the satisfying conditions are printed. 

Then, another condition is added to the predicate, y < 1, and the program checks again whether the statement is satisfied, and if it is,the conditions required are printed.
